# Figma Prototype
https://www.figma.com/design/dRrwQRsEXqcA9jeGNfToJM/AAC-Go-Fish-Prototype?node-id=0-1&t=EJZz9HW8ZuNciFbV-1

The Figma prototype linked above contains a mockup/wireframe of the AAC Go Fish game menu. Each 'Flow' represents a different use case and how a user will perform several different actions. Following each flow 
demonstrates how users will navigate different components of the game, such as the main menu, interacting with the UI, opening AAC dialogues, and more. The prototype also serves as a visual representation of the design
which can be referenced while implementing the front end components.
